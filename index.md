## Privacy Policy

This privacy policy governs your use of the Cashier AR app for Apple devices (Mac, iPhone and iPad) that was created by Mehmet Bayram. The Application lets you read barcodes and save them in the application. With this app you can save barcodes of real products at prices you set yourself and simulate a cashier. If you scan a barcode for which you have not defined a price before, a random price between 1 and 100 is determined. You can save this price later on your own barcodes and update it with the price you want, and now the price of that barcode is always read as the price you set. The application supports many types of barcodes, including QR code. With this app you can play cashier game with your kids using real product boxes and packages. Fill your shopping cart by scanning the products and simulate card payment as if you are taking payment with an NFC supported card to get paid. Note that all this is just a simulation and will not make any changes to your card. Your kids will love it. In addition, if you are a market employee or a grocer, this application can be very useful for you. Save the barcode of all your products in the application and pass the products at the checkout using the application. You will not need to make calculations in your mind.
